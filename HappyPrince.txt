In a city's heart stands the statue of the Happy Prince, adorned with precious stones and covered in gold leaf, admired by all for its beauty. The once living prince lived a life of luxury and pleasure confined on his palace, unknowing to the suffering outside. But as a statue on high ground, he sees the misery and poverty inflicted to his (former) subjects thoughout the city, and as such he is deeply touched with compassion for the people he had ignored previously.
One night a swallow, migrating to Egypt, stops to rest at the feet of the statue, and realizes that the Happy Prince is droping tears of sorrow, witnessing the suffering of his people.
Touched by it, the swallow agrees to help him, delivering a ruby to a poor seamstress whose son is ill, bringing relief to them.
Asked again in the following day, the swallow delivers one of the prince saphire eyes to a young playwritter who is too cold to finish his work, and the dayafter gives the other sapphire eye to a poor match-girl who is afraid to go home and be beaten by her father, making the swallow deeply devoted to the prince due to his caring heart and consequent blindness.
Staying by his side describing the scenes of the city, winter approaches and the swallow continues to help the prince distributes gold leafs from his body to the poor, bringing them relief and comfort.
Eventually the swallow cannot bear the cold and dies at the feet of the Happy Prince, leaving it heartbroken, literally. The next day, the Town authorities decide to melt down the then shabby statue, but its lead heart does not melt and is discarded along with the swallow’s body.
Then God’s angels, looking for the two most precious things in the city, retrieve the lead heart and the dead bird, providing both of them an eternal place in heaven.

The Happy Prince story is plenty of mistreatment and manipulation of the poor and the weak by the rich and affluent people.
A good example is the seamstress having “coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle”... embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball, having her little boy lying ill, asking for oranges, crying, and she has nothing to give him but river water… While at the palace a beautiful girl comments that had ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on her dress, “but the seamstresses are so lazy.”
Somewhere eles, the swallow saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates... Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm. “How hungry we are!” they said. “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.
The scenes above show how the wealthy live in confort and opulence, ignoring the hardships faced by the poor, they are often blind to the suffering just beyond their immediate view, and the Happy Price was no different earlier in life, saying “When I was alive and had a human heart, I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.”
This tale resonates deeply with the themes of social disparity and the enormous gap between the rich and the poor, exposing class divide, exploitation and neglect of the poor by the rich, and the narrative pinpoints that the wealthy has a responsibility to help the less fortunate, criticizing those who ignore this duty in favor of maintaining their own lifestyle, revealing a timeless reflection on the moral failures of societal inequality.

    2. In The Happy Prince, whose sacrifice is greater? The prince’s or the swallow’s? Justify your answer. No less than 300 words.
The sacrifice of the Happy Prince differs in nature from the sacrifice of the swallow, so let’s have a look on the implications of their respective sacrifices.
The Happy Prince, a statue adorned with precious stones, symbolizes opulence and ignorance transformed into empathy and compassion, so he decides to strip himself of all his wealth to aid those in need, giving away his ruby, sapphire eyes and the gold leaf coverage, becoming no longer beautiful, culminating in his physical disfigurement and societal rejection. As such, he moves from a state of vanity and aesthetic pleasure to one of selflessness and moral beauty, highlighting his understanding of the superficiality of material wealth and the enduring value of compassion, finalizing being melted and having his lead heart discharged.
Looking now at the swallow’s sacrifice, initially intending to migrate to Egypt to join his friends, he postpones his journey out of loyalty and compassion for the Prince, extending ultimately through the harsh winter, and as a symbol of freedom and transience, sacrifices his dreams of warmth and companionship for someone else’s mission, having his actions driven by love and empathy. His sacrifices grow in magnitude, enduring the cold and increasingly harsh conditions, and the ultimate sacrifice comes when staying with the Prince and eventually succumbs to the cold, dying as an act of self-sacrifice, giving his life out of love and loyalty.
When comparing the sacrifices of the Prince and the Swallow, it is crucial to consider the nature and consequences of their actions. The Prince sacrifices his wealth, beauty, and ultimately his societal standing, going through a profound transformation, representing a moral and spiritual awakening.
However, the Swallow’s sacrifice is more personal and existential, giving up his freedom, warmth, and ultimately his life, not driven by a transformation but by loyalty and compassion, highlighting a selfless love and the lengths to which one can go for the sake of another.
As such, I am compelled to say that the swallow’s sacrifice is greater than the Happy Prince´s one.
